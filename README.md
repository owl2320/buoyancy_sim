This is a simple and sometimes buggy buoyancy simulator.This uses python and pygame for doing everything.
There are mainly 2 classes in here.They are-Pseudo_Liquid and Object.
Pseudo Liquid and Object each have methods named apply effects or motion,draw and update.
Pseudo Liquid is responsible for showing some of the properties of a liquid whereas Object is responsible for determining how an object should behave
This uses mostly bult-in libs like random and sys and only uses pygame as a 3rd party lib
